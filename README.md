# Project 1

In the mini project, I analyzed the Annual Developer Survey from StackOverflow from 2019 to 2021 to analysis the education and language preference of the programmers from the United States.

I wrote a short report which answered 4 questions:

- 1.What is the relationship between working years/education and salary?
- 2.Do professional developers have a higher the education level?
- 3.Do students in this survey tend to have a higher the education level?
- 4.What is the most popular language among professional developers in the recent 3 years？
