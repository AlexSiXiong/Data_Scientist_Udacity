# Project 1

In this mini project, we will use the Annual Developer Survey from StackOverflow from 2019 to 2021 to analysis the education and language preference of the programmers from the United States.

This short report will answer 4 questions:

- 1.What is the relationship between working years/education and salary?
- 2.Do professional developers have a higher the education level?
- 3.Do students in this survey tend to have a higher the education level?
- 4.What is the most popular language among professional developers in the recent 3 yearsï¼Ÿ

# Motivation for this Project

There are some Kaggle dataset I am interested in, and I have some jupyter notebooks that recorded the competitions I participated. 
Then I realized that those competition notebooks only solved on single question that the organizers had asked, so I decided to make a good use of this opportunity to examine some data that I had not worked with before.
The Annual Developer Survey itself is also a good resources for me to learn the trend in the industry.

# Summary
- Most professional developers have high education experience.
- A rising cohort of US coders under the age of 18.
- The popularity of C++ decreased, and Frontend tech stack is hot. This trend seems to be lasting.

Udacity provides the best practices in data processing including data cleaning, data processing process and so on, which guides me in this completing this project.

StackOverflow provides the data I need for this project, and there are more valuable information I can dig in using those data.
